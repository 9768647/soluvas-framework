h1. Soluvas Notify

Unified notification and reminder library, can be used for general/untagged outbound email, tagged outbound email, inbound email (replies), other channels, and in-app notification systems.

Notification elements:

1. *Inbound Channel / Outbound Delivery.* Which can be email, Apple/iOS APN, SMS, social media (Twitter, Facebook, etc.), other means,
   or in-app messaging/story/notification system. Camel can also be used. @org.soluvas.email@ is available for transactional
   email delivery.
2. *Rules*. Can use Drools aka Soluvas Rules, but can be something simple or Java coded.
3. *Scheduling*. Uses Quartz to schedule reminder notifications before, on, or after a specific time,
   which depends on an entity (e.g. Checklist).
4. *Trigger*. Some notifications are triggered by EventBus, others are run via *Scheduling*.  
5. *Predicates/Checks*. Related to *Rules*, but basically a boolean function that when evaluated,
   determines whether the notification should be sent. e.g. Send Overdue1 notification for a Checklist,
   but only if the Checklist hasn't yet been done.
7. *Templating*. The recommended templating mechanism is Mustache. *Soluvas Email* internally uses Mustache.
6. *MIME/Attachments support: Static & Dynamic*. For dynamic files, generates bytes, MIME type, content length, and filename + extension.
   *Soluvas Email* also supports attachments.
