h1. Soluvas Data

Inspired by, and includes code from, "Spring Data Commons":http://www.springsource.org/spring-data/commons .

h2. Q&A

h3. Will Soluvas Data merge with Spring Data?

Short answer: Not likely.

Soluvas Data aims to be practical, efficient, generic, and safe.

Among the features:

1. Suitable as remote interface (coarse-grained)
2. Callback support
3. Asynchronous support
4. Progress reporting
5. Result reporting
6. Static analysis

It's always possible to wrap Soluvas Data with Spring Data and vice versa using delegating adapter.
