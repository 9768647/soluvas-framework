h1. Single-tenant Realms Configuration

Use @DefaultWebSecurityManager@ with either @MongoRealm@ or @CouchDbRealm@,
where the @Realm@'s @name@ should be set to (application-wide) @tenantId@, which will be used as
@UsernamePasswordToken.host@ (see @LoginButton@) for example.

A @Realm@ implementation should check whether @UsernamePasswordToken@'s @host@ matches its @name@,
which makes it also work in multitenant configuration.

h2. Multitenant Realms Configuration

Use @DefaultWebSecurityManager@ with @realmBeanRepo@ containing either @MongoRealm@ or @CouchDbRealm@,
where each @Realm@'s @name@ should be set to @tenantId@, which will be used as
@UsernamePasswordToken.host@ (see @LoginButton@) for example.

A @Realm@ implementation should check whether @UsernamePasswordToken@'s @host@ matches its @name@.
